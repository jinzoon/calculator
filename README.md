# JavaScript Calculator

A fully functional calculator built with **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript** as part of [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/).  
It supports basic arithmetic, sign toggling, deletion, and chaining operations â€” styled to look like a classic digital LCD calculator.

## What I Practiced

- DOM manipulation with `querySelector`, `querySelectorAll`, and event listeners
- Handling multiple states (`firstNum`, `secondNum`, `currentNum`, etc.)
- Operator chaining logic
- String/number conversions and edge-case handling
- Formatting long outputs with `toExponential()`
- Flexbox for responsive layout
- Using a custom font with `@font-face`

## Known Quirks

- Calculator does not currently implement operator precedence (PEMDAS). Operations are performed sequentially (as per project requirements). 
- Input is limited to one operator at a time (as per project requirements).

## Technologies Used

- HTML5
